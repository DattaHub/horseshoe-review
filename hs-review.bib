Many implementations of MCMC methods do not extend easily to parallel computing environments, as their inherently sequential nature incurs a large synchronization cost. In this paper, we show how to do Gibbs sampling in a fully data-parallel manner on a graphics processing unit (GPU) for a large class of exchangeable models that admit latent variable representations. We demonstrate the scheme on a horseshoe probit regression model, and find that our implementation scales effectively to thousands of predictors and millions of data points simultaneously.},
